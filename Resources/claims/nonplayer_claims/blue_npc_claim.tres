info = "This is a funny 5th claim that I wanted to add, but didn't get time to do it, only acts as a refrence to Team Fortres 2, and acts as Unused content. How you were suposed to see it was through naming a player ether, [Builders, Builders League, or Blu] and start the game, and that player would be replaced by this.

So if your reading this... Hi, I hope you've injoyed this game that you'd data mine it.

Ah, who am I kidding, noone is going to read this."
